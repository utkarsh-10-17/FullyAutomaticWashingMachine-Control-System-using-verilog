# FullyAutomaticWashingMachine-Control-System-using-verilog
A Verilog HDL-based finite state machine (FSM) implementation for an automatic washing machine. Features include timer-based state transitions, mode selection, lid detection, and real-time feedback via a seven-segment display. Prototyped on the DE10-Lite FPGA board using Intel® MAX® 10 FPGA.
